It seems that the angle and rotation of the plate can be adjusted. Also, in the room there are two statues guarding two doors; one is the God Re and the other the God Thorth. Both statues have a square piece of coloured glass in their chests. Maybe we can reflect the beam of light into one of the statue’s chest?"
